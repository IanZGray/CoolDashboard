# Cool Character Dashboard
This React project was sytled using TailwindCSS, React-Icons, and SyncFusion

The point of this is to demonstrate dashboard functionality and state management
while using different charts. There is also calandar and Kanban functionality. 
You can create your own custom character based on some preset styles and colors. 
You can also change the character's name. 
The character information is stored in state and maintained in localStorage. 
There's also a page that links to ReadyPlayerMe and provides the user with the generated character's url.
